abstract: "HSRL (Horn clause/Schema Representation Language) is the result of an effort to combine the methods of logic programming and schema based knowledge represention into a single hybrid system. In HSRL, knowledge expressed in schemata, can be accessed during the execution of logic programs, and the retrieval of the values of a slot in a schema can involve the execution of logic programs that attempt to deduce the values prior to resorting to inheritance, should the slot be empty. HSRL supports the implementation of programs that take advantage of the best features of the logical and object-oriented approaches to knowledge representation."
