abstract: "We provide an overview of the Automated Software Development Workstation Project, an effort to explore knowledge-based approaches to increasing software productivity. The project focuses on applying the concept of domain-specific automatic programming systems (D-SAPSs) to application domains at NASA's Johnson SPace Center. We describe a version of a DSAPS developed in Phase I of the project for the domain Space Station momentum management, and discuss how problems enocuntered during its implementation have led us to concentrate our efforts on simplifying the process of building and extended such systems. We propose to do this by attacking three observed bottlenecks in the D-SAPS development process through the increased automation of the acquisition of programming knowledge and the use of an object-oriented development methodology at all stages of program design. We discuss how these ideas are being implemented in the Bauhaus, a prototype CASE workstation for D-SAPS development."
