abstract: "A case-based reasoning system which is smoothly integrated into a rule-based reasoning system, thus coordinating case
based reasoning techniques and rule-based reasoning tech
niques in a unified automated reasoning system, in which an
automated processor may proceed by inferential reasoning
on the facts of the problem and the cases by means of
rule-based reasoning techniques or based on procedural directives supplied by a human programmer, and may select
the case which is the best match for the problem, but may act
differently from the precise action prescribed for that case.
A technique for dynamically adapting the case base to the
problems which the automated reasoning system encounters,
in which the processor may create additional cases which
may exemplify the problem or which may be useful for
future problems, or may remove cases from the case base
which it determines from experience are poor or obsolete. A
technique in which the processor may be set to work with a
limited case base, and may solicit human advice for treat
ment of new problems which are not already well-treated by
the case base. "
