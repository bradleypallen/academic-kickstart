abstract: "One embodiment of the present invention provides a system
for making predictions about data records from an incoming
stream of data records. This system operates by discovering
predictive relationships in an online manner between fields
in records in the incoming stream of data records as the
incoming stream of data records is received. These predic tive relationships can used to predict values in fields based on other field values in the same record. This facilitates
cleansing of data by allowing transaction values to be
validated based upon predictions made from other field
values in the same transaction record. It also allows missing field values to be predicted based upon the other field values.
A variation of this embodiment provides for filtering transaction records based upon discovered predictive relationships and routing the transaction records to other servers in
real-time. Another embodiment forms association rules between fields in records in the incoming s of records,
and outputs these association rules for viewing by a human
decision-maker. In another embodiment, the present invention comprises a server with an online predictive memory
that can be incorporated into a heterogeneous network as a server. This embodiment is scalable and can be incorporated into an existing network with minimal integration effort.
Note that the underlying model for this system continuously
adapts to changes in the incoming stream of records over
time without the need for any human intervention."
