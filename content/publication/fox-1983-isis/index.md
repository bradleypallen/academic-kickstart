abstract: "Analysis of the job shop scheduling domain has indicated that the crux of the scheduling problein is the
deterniination and satisfaction of a large number and variety of constraints. Schedules are influenced by such
diverse factors as due date requirements, cost restrictions, production levels, machine capabilities, operation
precedences. resource requirements, and resource availability. This paper describes ISIS, a scheduling system
capable of incorporating all relevant constraints in the construction of job shop schedules. We exnmine both
the representation of constraints within ISIS, and the manner in which these constraints are utilized in
conducting a constraint-directed search for an acceptable schedule. The important issues relating to the
relaxation of constraints are addressed. Finally, the interactive scheduling facilities provided by ISIS are
considered."
