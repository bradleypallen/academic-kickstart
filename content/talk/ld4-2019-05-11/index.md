summary: At the 2019 LD4 Conference on Linked Data in Libraries, Brad described his work on the use of library ontology standards, linked open data and minimal computing (in the digital humanities sense) to publish scholarly bibliographical data.
abstract: The work of the American Beat Generation author William S. Burroughs is notorious among collectors and bibliographers for its scale and complexity. In this presentation, we describe our objectives and experiences in representing, enhancing, and publishing the information in Brian E.C. Schottlaender’s scholarly bibliography Anything But Routine v4.0 as linked data using BIBFRAME 2.0 and ARM ontologies.
